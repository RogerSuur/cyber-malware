# Malware

This project teaches antivirus and malware by developing a malware encryption and decryption program.

The goal for this project is to create a simple ransomware program that will encrypt all files on a user's computer, issuing a ransom note with an encryption key at the end. The created program should not be detected with Windows Defender and in more than 80% of Security vendors in virustotal.

# Overview

The malware application encrypts all the files in the folder where its located utilizing Pythons `cryptography`, then makes a ransom note with the decryption code in it.
It escapes antivirus tests with increasing files size.

# Prerequisites

### Python 3.x

Python 3.x installed on your machine or VM.

### cryptography library

Cryptography library needs to be installed. You can install it using pip:

    pip install cryptography

### PyInstaller

Install PyInstaller for building Python script as executable

    pip install pyinstaller

# Installation

For installation make sure to have antivirus turned off, (after that it can be turned back on again). Run the builder file with

    python builder.py

Move the decrypt.py file and any other file you might want to encrypt to the dist folder (for example the txt files). After that you can delete malware.py
Run the malware.exe as an administrator. You should see the txt files encrypted and a ransom note generated. To decrypt, run decrypt.py and paste the key you get in the ransom_note.
